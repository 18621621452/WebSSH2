# Instructions
To install:

1. Clone to a location somewhere and `npm install`

2. If desired, edit config.json to change the listener to your liking. There are also some default options which may be definied for a few of the variables.

3. Run `npm start`

4. Fire up a browser, navigate to IP/port of your choice and specify a host (https isn't used here because it's assumed it will be off-loaded to
some sort of proxy):

http://localhost:2222/ssh/host/127.0.0.1

You will be prompted for credentials to use on the SSH server via HTTP Basic authentcaiton. This is to permit usage with some SSO systems that can replay credentials over HTTP basic.
